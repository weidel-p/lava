class AbstractProcessModel(ABC):
    """Represents a model that implements the behavior of a Process.

    ProcessModels enable seamless cross-platform execution of Processes. In
    particular, they enable building applications or algorithms using Processes
    agnostic of the ProcessModel chosen at compile time. There are two
    broad categories of ProcessModels:
    1. LeafProcessModels allow to implement the behavior of a Process
    directly in different languages for a particular compute resource.
    ProcessModels specify what Process they implement and what
    SynchronizationProtocol they implement (if necessary for the operation of
    the Process). In addition, they specify which compute resource they require
    to function. All this information allows the compiler to map a Process
    and its ProcessModel to the appropriate hardware platform.
    2. SubProcessModels allow to implement and compose the behavior of a
    Process in terms of other Processes. This enables the creation of
    hierarchical Processes and reuse of more primitive ProcessModels to
    realize more complex ProcessModels. SubProcessModels inherit all compute
    resource requirements from the Processes they instantiate. See
    documentation of AbstractProcessModel for more details.

    ProcessModels are usually not instantiated by the user directly but by
    the compiler. ProcessModels are expected to have the same variables and
    ports as those defined in the Process but with an implementation specific
    to the ProcessModel. I.e. in a PyProcessModel, a Var will be implemented by
    a np.ndarray and a Port might be implemented with a PyInputPort.
    The compiler is supposed to instantiate these ProcModels and initialize
    those vars and ports given initial values from the Process and
    implementation details from the ProcModel.
    For transparency, class attributes and their types should be
    explicitly defined upfront by the developer of a ProcModel to avoid lint
    warnings due to unresolved variables or unknown or illegal types.

    This is a proposal of a low-boilerplate code convention to achieve this:

    1. The same Vars and Ports as defined in the Process must be defined as
       class variables in the ProcessModels.
    2. These class variables should be initialized with LavaType objects.
       LavaTypes specify the future class-type of this Var or Port, the numeric
       d_type and precision and maybe dynamic range if different from what
       would be implied by d_type. The compiler will later read these LavaTypes
       defined at the class level to initialize concrete class objects from the
       initial values provided in the Process. During this process, the
       compiler will create object level attributes with the same name as the
       class level variables. This should not cause problems as class level and
       instance level attributes can co-exist. However, instance level
       attributes shadow class level attributes with the same name if they
       exist.
    3. Direct type annotations should be used equal to the class type in
       the LavaType to suppress type warnings in the rest of the class code
       although this leads to a bit of verbosity in the end. We could leave out
       the class type in the LavaType and infer it from
       ProcModel.__annotations__ if the user has not forgotten to specify it.
    3. Process can communicate arbitrary objects using it's ``proc_params``
       member. This should be used when such a need arises. A Process's
       ``proc_prams`` (empty dictionary by default) should always be used to
       initialize it's ProcessModel.
